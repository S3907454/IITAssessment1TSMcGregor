										<h2 class="major">Personal Profile </h2>
										<p>I am fourth generation Australian, though with a last name such as mine, it is not surprising that we have kept close ties to our Scottish heritage. My brothers and I can now also go by the title of Laird (Lord) of Glencoe and Lochaber. Though this is obviously nothing too serious. Scotland has this program where you can purchase square metres of land to help preserve and return previous agricultural land back to the original wild forests.  It does make you feel more connected to our ancestors even though we are so far removed from the homeland both in distance and generations.<p>

										<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
										<p>I have always had an interest in technology, from medical and physics to mechanical and astronomical. Though I may not fully understand the research, the implementation, and the advancement they provided I have always found fascinating. Always move forward, learn from the past but do not get stuck there.<p>
<P>This interest started back when I was a kid watching all the afternoon cartoons and sci-fi shows and movies. The reliance on providing the actual science behind such fanciful stories was not called for at that time and so your imagination could just open up and run wild.  From Astroboys flying cars and video phones, to Starwars space travel and floating cities.<p>

										<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
										<p>The ideal job that I would strive towards would be as an IT Officer with the Australian Antarctic Program.
This would entail the management, implementation and maintenance of the IT systems required for the scientific research being conducted at the Australian Antarctic stations.  Not being an actual scientist does not mean we cannot be part of one of the worlds latest and ongoing research endeavours.

									<h2 class="major">Project</h2>
									<p>Every year across this continent we brace ourselves against the harsh environment through bush fires and flooding. Every year we bring our brave volunteers together and help those that are hit the hardest whilst trying to either hold back or control the flames or send out boats to rescue those who were either too remote or was not fast enough to get out of the way from the oncoming floods.<p>
<p>Though there is not too much we can do about the environment or the weather, what we can do and what I hope I can show you today, is to ensure not only a quick response time in the search and rescue during these events but also assist in some additional prevention efforts as well.<p>
<p>Technology has come a long way, components are smaller with still greater processing power, and with this I am hoping we can make a change and ensure we can bring safety and assist to all people affected by these annual events.<p>
<p>With HIVE like programming, I am wanting to utilise the flexibility and speed of drones to assist the search and rescue and firefighting teams.<p>
<p>Therefore, being able to cover a greater area with the drones all networked together to a main mobile system such as either a helicopter, fire truck or just a 4wd.  Processing all the information and getting directions from the teams as required.<p>

									<h3 class="major">Search and Rescue</h3>
									<p>Being able to link these drones up to the main search vehicle will allow the rescuers onboard to cover a great land area with unnecessary additional risk to these people.<p>
<p>The drones would be able to get into areas where the terrain is difficult if you were trying to go via foot and cover the area at greater speed.
<p>Depending on the need we can attach additional devices to the drones such as heat vision sensors for either new fires and remain embers and with an attached extinguisher could put that fire out before any further break outs happen.<p>
<p>In relation to flooding, we can attach supplies to the drones and fly them to the people who have been cut off until the rescue teams turn up to get them out. Alternatively, the drones could drop off inflatable rafts for the people to get themselves to safety, speeding up their own recovery and being able to direct actual rescue personnel to areas where their need would be greater.<p>
<p>How many times have we seen on the TV that someone is stuck in the middle of a fast-flowing river up a tree or on top of a vehicle and then one of the rescue team would have to rope up and swim out to them to then get both pulled back by the teams on the bank.  With the drones would not have to risk anyone as the drone can simply be flown out with the rope to the person in trouble, we could even attach a speaker and mic to the drone so they can be communicated with and instructed on how to prepare the safety rope and when done advise they are ready to be pulled to shore.<p>
<p>The drones are not to replace the brave people of the search and rescue teams but to be in addition to lower their risks with the greater dangerous and allow them to focus their efforts else were if needed.<p>
<p>This technology can also be adapted to be used the search and rescue of lost bush walkers.<p>
<p>Utilising the speed and area they can cover this would greatly limit the time that someone would be lost in the bush and be at the mercy of the elements, especially if they are injured.<p>
<p>Again, a safety pack (containing food, water, blanket, first aid kit etc) could be attached to the drone so when someone is found it can be dropped to them until the rescue team can reach them.  With the radio on the drone, they can communicate with the lost walker to help reassure them and determine the nature of any injuries.<p>

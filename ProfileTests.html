									<h3 class="major">Personal Profile</h3>
									<p>Though throughout my working career I have obtained various certificates focusing on the office administrative environment, the highest official complete education I have achieve is the Senior Certificate from High School.
As much as I love the comforts and conveniences of the city life, I do love camping and getting away from it all.  I have a great affinity with the bush over going to the beach. Sun, sand, salt, no thank you.  Being in the mountains amongst the trees especially in the cooler months is such a recharged to the system both mentally and physically.
										</p>
									
									<h3 class="major">Profile Results</h3>
									<p>Being more of a diplomatic team member would allow me to be more of a liaison between team members to help get either their ideas across or ensure there is a common understanding of where we are headed. Also, to keep track of where the team is at if there are any falling behind, needing additional assistance or resources to help them achieve their goal.  </p>

									<p>In conjunction with my more visual learning style bringing forth my ideas in a graphical, dot point way over a lengthy textbook of wording or lecture would ensure my ideas would also be easily explained to the other members.  Taking all this into account, I would be trying to find members whose strengths would compliment my own, such as a focused logic, a gifted speaker and showman and a strong understanding leader.</p>
									
									<p>Below are the results of the profile tests I have completed to date.  I do agree with the results of me being more of a diplomatic personality and visual/audio learner.</p>
									<p>I added the links for each of the tests if you are interested in them further and would like to give them a go yourself.</p>

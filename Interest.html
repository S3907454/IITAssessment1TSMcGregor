									<h3 class="major">Interest in IT</h3>
									<p>My current IT experience has only been limited to working as an administrator. In this position I was a huge end user, as are most people nowadays, but also, due to my interest was the go-to guy for the setting up of pcs, small cable adjustments in the server room and trouble shooting before staff would then go to the IT help desk for more serious issues.  Personally, my experience is gaming. MMOs mostly with some shooters and city builders.<p>
<p>Unfortunately, RMIT was not my first choice. As I am from Central Queensland, I was looking at UCQ and James Cook. But due to their limitation with providing online learning, I did some further research and found RMIT via OUA.  Being in the regions and having the option to do this course fully online was ideal.<p>
<p>Again, further testament to the wonders and advancement of technology proving that distance and remoteness is no longer a disadvantage to receiving great education.<p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, I am a great end user of technology, so with doing this course I am hoping to move into being at the forefront and contribute to the emerging technologies, essentially completing the loop.  Be it in programming a far more efficient business database system or assisting on a scientific research team adapting programs and equipment on the go.  Learning the basics, the roots, of IT would set me up to help future proof my job prospects.
<p>As IT changes very rapidly, the knowledge and skills obtain form this course will help me adapt quicker to the ever transforming industry.<p>

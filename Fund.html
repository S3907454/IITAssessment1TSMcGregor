									<h3 class="major">Funding</h3>
									<p>We have a history of great volunteers in this country and the generosity of the public is always above and beyond.<p>
<p>These drones would be an ideal alternative to say trying to raise funds for another helicopter to help patrol the coastline.<p>
<p>Be it an individual drone could be fully funding by one community, a school fundraiser, or a community group.<p>
<p>A far more achievable outcome than a new vehicle. Not to mention the cheaper on-going running costs of a drone.<p>
<p>This with possible government funding could really see this technology benefit everyone.<p>


									<h3 class="major">Expansion</h3>
									<p>With the ever-going advancements in technology, we can see this search and rescue hive drone technology be utilised in other areas as well,<p> 
<p>- scientific patrols of the Antarctic ice sheets on a more regular basis<p>
<p>- with more powerful and longer lasting batteries, search efforts out in the middle of the ocean for lost boats or planes can last longer and a lot cheaper.<p>
<p>- with greater and wider range of sensors attached, we can use the drones to fly over forests or great expanse of deserts to track and record any animal migrations and the state of the populations, even to help in Africa against poachers on the reserves.<p>
<p>As technology also becomes cheaper this technology could also be used in the private sector,<p> 
<p>- farmers patrolling their stock on the vast stations in the outback, or the health of the agricultural crops on the coast.<p>
<p>- assist with Police in manhunts or car chases, having the drones being up in the sky as a good distance and still be able to track the suspect would prevent any serious risk to that person or the public where unlike today a car chase can cause a serious car crash risking the lives of suspect, police, and any bystanders alike.

									<p>We will be developing a Hive programming and triggering mechanism that would link the drones to a parent system, usually linked to a mobile vehicle in the area. Depending on the need of the drone, the programming can be adjusted for either just search or it can also include the addition of when a certain parameter is met, would then release the package, or trigger the fire extinguisher to or near its target.<p>
<p>This can be an automatic process, or the release and flight of the drone be controlled manually.<p>
<p>The drones would come with a HD camera with heat sensing ability.<p>
<p>A lightweight frame with a release mechanism built onto the underneath of the drone would be where various attachments can be made depending on the requirements at that time, be it a fire extinguisher, safety packages or flotation devices.<p>
<p>The drones can carry approx. 20 to 30 kgs, so carrying a small to medium fire extinguisher would be no problem.<p>
<p>For the parent vehicles, pending on the size of the vehicle, they could host from 3 to 5 drones depending on the needs.<p>
<p>A lightweight frame could be easily manufactured to suit the vehicle, much like a roof rack on a 4wd.<p>
<p>The drones can be charged either by portable solar panels or via the vehicles car battery if required.<p>
<p>For a helicopter, the lightweight frame could be fitted to the under carriage between the legs of the vehicle and the drones released when needed.<p>

									<h3 class="major">Prevention and Patrol</h3>
									<p>Like the search and rescue process, prevention and patrol could be utilised before any disaster eventuates.<p>
<p>We have great expanses of national parks and wild bush land and unfortunately the park rangers and local councils cannot be everywhere all the time, yet with the Hive drone system, they can attach drones to the roof of a 4wd and from the vehicle send them out to cover the area.<p>  
<p>Communicating with each as so they know which areas have not only been covered but at what time.  When an issue is found, such as a small fire starting up, they can alert the other drones then, with the attached extinguishers, can all converge on the area to get the fire under control.<p>
<p>Again, the drones would be attached with heat sensors to help search out any fires in the under brush far for efficiently then just a visual fly over.<p>
<p>Using this technology of scanning the environment for any concerns, could also be used with the life savers and coast guard.<p>
<p>The life saver could be at their station manning a beach until they see and swimmer in distress.  With special binoculars they can laser point the swimmer and from their vehicle release a drone with an attached flotation device to fly out to the person in distress to drop the flotation device to them until the life saver can get to them.  Thus, saving valuable time getting the person back to the beach without unnecessary further injuries.<p>

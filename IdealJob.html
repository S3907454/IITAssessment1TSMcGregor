									<h3 class="major">IDEAL JOB</h3>
									<p>Short of space travel and exploration, working in Antarctica would be a great adventure, seeking new knowledge of our planets past, gathering information of the planets current environmental status, even using the non-polluted skies above to explore ever further into outer space.  
<p>To be able to say that you had worked on such projects with the great scientist of the day would be a true honour not only for myself but also to my family.<p>
<p>Due to the remoteness of the position, being able to adapt and troubleshoot with high efficiency would be a great benefit as resources and further support could be over a month away, even longer pending weather conditions.<p>
<p>Having several years of experience with IT, in particular networking and troubleshooting would be ideal.  Experience in a large company with a complex IT system, I believe, would suit ideally. Even better would be to get the chance to work with other science teams, perhaps at a university, CSIRO or Bureau of Meteorology.<p>  
<p>Currently my experience is greatly lacking to which I hope this course will help set me up on the right path.  Though I have worked for a large organisation being the Queensland Government and had to assist in the administrative management of up to 3 departments in the same location at once, providing me with some of the complexity experience needed.  My IT experience would not be currently sufficient for this jobs requirements.
So, with my success of obtaining my IT degree in 3 years and my experience with working for the Queensland Government for almost 20 years. I would hope to find a position with a company to get some real-world experience to add to my profile.<p>
<p>I would like to prove myself to the company and stay at the one job to show stability for at least 3 to 5 years all the while keeping my eye on the Antarctica job site for when they advertise again for this position.</p>
